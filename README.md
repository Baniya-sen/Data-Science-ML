# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This collection of Jupyter Notebooks showcases my learning journey via Data Science courses through various analyses and visualizations of datasets in CSV format. Each project is a step towards mastering data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a portfolio of my work as I delve into the world of Data Science and Machine Learning. It includes a variety of projects that demonstrate my ability to handle data, extract insights, and build predictive models.

## Projects

Here is a list of some of the key projects included in this repository:

1. **Dr. Semmelweis Handwash Discovery**
   - Description: Dr Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician born in 1818 who worked in the Vienna General Hospital. In the past people thought of illness as caused by "bad air" or evil spirits. But in the 1800s Doctors started looking more at anatomy, doing         
     autopsies, and making arguments based on data. Dr Semmelweis suspected that something was going wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital. Semmelweis wanted to figure out why so many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever (i.e., 
     puerperal fever).

2. **Nobel Price Analysis**
   - Description: On November 27, 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will in Paris. When it was opened after his death, the will caused a lot of controversy, as Nobel had left much of his wealth for the establishment of a prize. Alfred Nobel dictates that his entire 
     remaining estate should be used to endow “prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind”.
     Every year the Nobel Prize is given to scientists and scholars in the categories of chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace.

3. **Multivariable Regression and_Valuation Model**
   - Description: Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s! Imagine you're working for a real estate development company. Your company wants to value any residential project before they start.
      This project will :
      Analyse and explore the Boston house price data, 
      Split data for training and testing, 
      Run a Multivariable Regression, 
      Evaluate how your model's coefficients and residuals, 
      Use data transformation to improve your model performance, 
      Use a model to estimate a property price.
    - Keywords: #analyse, #split-training-testing #multivariable-regression #coefficients #data-transformation #estimate
      
... and many more.

Each project folder contains:

- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with the analysis and code.
- The corresponding CSV file(s) used in the project.
